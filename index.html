                    <p>Washington University&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability released updates on their five-year plan from 2015 that reveal significant progress toward more sustainable operations, March 16.</p>

                    <p>The strategic plan was broken into eight key areas: energy and emissions, landscape, water, transportation, food, community, buildings and waste. Progress updates for six of these areas are available to the public, while the buildings and waste updates have yet to be posted.</p>

                    <p>The goals for the water objectives were marked as achieved, transportation goals were achieved, one objective was met in the area of food while two are &ldquo;in progress,&rdquo; community objectives were achieved, energy and emissions goals are currently &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; and the goals of landscape are half achieved and half &ldquo;on track.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>This is the second strategic plan for sustainable operations by the University after the first was created through a collaboration of students, faculty and staff in 2010.</p>

                    <p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Sustainability Phil Valko, said that the 2015 plan&rsquo;s ambition fueled much of the drive to accomplish the goals.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We really have made pretty meaningful progress, so I'm proud of actually the whole portfolio of work,&rdquo; Valko said. &ldquo;In 2015 when we published that &lsquo;15 to &lsquo;20 plan, we were being really ambitious and&#8230; that ambition, I think, paid off.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>According to Valko, some notable areas of improvement include five recent LEED certifications for buildings, the expansion of the student internship program, success with local food sourcing and the reduction of turf and performative landscape across campus, specifically the major green transformation of the East End.</p>

                    <p>One specific long-term goal the University set for sustainability standards in the 2010 plan was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The 2015 plan built upon the 2010 objectives to continue on this path. Hank Webber, Executive Vice Chancellor for Civic Affairs and Strategic Planning, said at the &ldquo;Wednesdays with WashU: Climate Action at WashU&rdquo; seminar that this ten-year goal has nearly been met.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;That does not sound like, nor is it a terribly ambitious goal, until you realize that we have doubled our square footage&#8230;and most of the emissions at Washington University come from&#8230;our physical footprint,&rdquo; Webber said. &ldquo;We are 98% of the way there as of 2020, and we will be 102% of the way there by 2021.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, another goal of the 2015 plan was to pursue renewable energy projects. In 2015, the first major sustainability project was to install solar panels on University-owned property. This was expanded upon in 2019 with a &ldquo;new $3.5 million solar photovoltaic project on the Danforth, Medical and North campuses.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Today, the University generates 2.5 megawatts of solar power, making it one of the largest consumers of on-site solar energy in the St. Louis area,&rdquo; the 2015 plan updates read.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, to achieve the sustainability goals outlined in the most recent plan, the University has made investments across campus operations. Many of these investments have also been profitable, with the largest profits coming from metering and retro-commissioning. Both metering and retro-commissioning work to quickly identify and correct energy inefficiencies.</p>

                    <p>Metering allows the University to collect data on the usage of electricity, hot water for heating, cold water for cooling and natural gas. Although there used to be only three meters on the Danforth campus, there are now 500.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;This cost $3 million on the Danforth campus and a similar amount in the medical school, and it was the best investment we ever made,&rdquo; Webber said.</p>

                    <p>Similarly, retro-commissioning involves analyzing building operations and making sure the systems are operating as efficiently as possible, which has proved effective on campus buildings. For example, retro-commissioning of just McDonnell Hall resulted in a 28% overall reduction in energy use and will save 938 metric tons of CO2 annually, according to data presented at the webinar.</p>

                    <p>The investments in energy conservation projects across campus enable the University to operate at a high level of efficiency, leading to both financial and environmental savings.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We have invested on the order of $50 million in an extensive set of energy conservation projects in our existing buildings,&rdquo; Webber said. &ldquo;We have a very formal economic model of net present value, but over a period of a maximum of eight or so years, these projects all pay for themselves...What's good for the planet is also good for the resources of the University,&rdquo; Webber added.</p>

                    <p>Alexis Tinoco, Geographical Information Systems Specialist Intern said that energy usage is the area that he would like to see substantively addressed in the next sustainability plan. According to Valko, this was one of the most challenging aspects of the 2015 plan in the area of carbon reduction and energy conservation.</p>

                    <p> &ldquo;I would really love to see some more ambitious goals respective to our energy usage,&rdquo; Tinoco wrote in a statement to Student Life. &ldquo;Specifically, I am eager to see the University commit to a carbon neutrality plan such as many peer institutions have already done.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Junior Mandy Huang, Strategic Planning Research and Coordination Associate, said the next plan should focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) should be central to strategic planning and I would love to see more concrete and measurable goals included in our University's and OOS's next iteration of Strategic Plans,&rdquo; Huang said, noting she was proud that Washington University was one of few schools to include a specific DEI hiring goal in their 2015 plan.</p>

                    <p>Tinoco also said that he hopes the University can be even more ambitious in addressing climate change for the entire St. Louis region, specifically by divesting from fossil fuels.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Wash. U.&rsquo;s impact stretches beyond the University community and it is imperative that the institution adopt a more aggressive plan to combat climate change,&rdquo; Tinoco said. &ldquo;The push for divestment has gained traction within the Wash. U. community over the years and it&rsquo;s time the administration hear the community&rsquo;s concerns.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Though there have been no indications that the University plans to fully divest from fossil fuels soon, a broader commitment to the St. Louis region could be realized in the form of local carbon offsets&mdash;a strategy Valko noted may be utilized by the University to create a pathway to carbon neutrality.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We're evaluating what carbon offsets would look like for the University&#8230;perhaps there's an opportunity to invest in energy efficiency projects here in the St Louis region in low income households so that the offsets&#8230;they help our local neighbors and that really ties into Chancellor Martin's vision of Wash. U. in St. Louis, for St. Louis,&rdquo; Valko said.</p>

                    <p>Huang said she would like to see the University adopt the carbon neutrality resolution passed by SU last year, making the community &ldquo;carbon neutral by 2035 or before and in alignment with the 100% renewable energy goal of the City of St. Louis or earlier.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The next strategic plan for sustainable operations is beginning to form under the University&rsquo;s wider strategic planning process, Valko said. Studies are also currently underway to help guide the ambitious goal-setting. As for a specific timeline for carbon neutrality, Webber said that a likely trajectory was 15 years.</p>

                    <p>Now that winter has come to an end, Missouri officials and the Division of Energy are having to reflect on their energy plans in response to an unexpectedly rough winter. <a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/historic-cold-snap-breaking-several-kansas-city-records/" target="_blank">Recent winters have not compared to this one</a> in terms of snow, ice, and temperature, and it has led Missouri to recognize how underprepared we are in our energy use and composition. On Feb. 13, around the beginning of the snowstorm conundrum, <a href="https://www.whiteriver.org/press_release/peak-alert-issued-in-extreme-weather-conditions/" target="_blank">many local electric cooperatives</a> in Missouri <a href="https://www.midamericanenergy.com/peak-alerts" target="_blank">issued a &ldquo;peak alert&rdquo;</a> which is when electricity usage is in peak demand, and the cooperatives may not have enough supply. This is usually announced to urge people to lower their thermostats, use less electricity and conserve other natural gases in their homes, because doing so creates a large demand for natural gases and overwhelms the market price of energy units. According to <a href="https://www.cityutilities.net/blackouts/" target="_blank">Springfield&rsquo;s City Utilities</a>, a dekatherm (<a href="https://www.cgcohio.com/faqs/what-dekatherm-dth" target="_blank">unit of measuring heat value of natural gas</a>) of nonrenewable natural gas went from a market price of $3.00 to nearly $400. Missouri isn&rsquo;t one of the top producers of coal, so in outages like those seen during February, the exorbitant coal market is the only backup for purchasing energy. This raised Missourians&rsquo; electricity bill an extreme amount and left many with cold homes and power outages.</p>

                    <p>Missouri is too reliant on coal, and this has resulted in a number of problems in recent years. In 2018, 73% of our <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/with-coals-dominance-in-missouri-prospects-of-clean-energy-transition-remain-uncertain/article_81b48f73-8b1c-59cc-8571-86e18576edec.html" target="_blank">energy was generated by coal, and only 6% was renewable</a>. While many other surrounding states have converted to a clean energy plan, Missouri has continually denied any advancement in this direction. There have been many efforts to shut down coal power plants, which is a step in the right direction, but in Missouri as well as other states across the nation, they have been replaced with fracking. Fracking has many awful side effects as well including pollution of water, soil and air.</p>

                    <p>It is also a common misconception that there can be &ldquo;clean&rdquo; natural resources. While it&rsquo;s true that some natural gases emit less carbon dioxide, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/natural-gas-and-the-environment.php" target="_blank">in recent years</a>, we have come to discover that the &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; of natural gases aren&rsquo;t really much better than any other fossil fuel like coal. In the process of mining for natural gases, methane is released in addition to many other pollutants. So, at best, they are &ldquo;less dirty,&rdquo; but not clean enough to be considered environmentally friendly.</p>

                    <p>While it may be cheaper for Missourians to use coal as the primary energy source, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a much larger problem looming over the state. It is even scarier to think about how much we rely on coal to power our state. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-oil-left-earth-2017-12-27" target="_blank">Worse, in 2014, studies estimated that the world had about 53 years worth of oil left</a>. If those numbers still hold true, that would leave us with about 47 years left. With a rising global awareness of carbon footprints, Missouri continues to drag down any progress surrounding states have made. The U.S. uses exponentially more oil than any other country in the world, and with the fracking boom, I can only imagine the consequences. With a state that is about five times smaller in population than Texas but consumes nearly two thirds the amount of coal that Texas uses, it is undoubtedly an issue that our officials are intentionally ignoring.</p>

                    <p>In 2015, Environmental Studies professor Bill Lowry sought to reshuffle the classroom, swapping synthetic obstacles offered by problem sets with real-world issues that require more nuanced solutions. He ultimately developed the Sustainability Exchange, a course that arranges upperclassmen into diverse teams that solve some of the St. Louis community&rsquo;s pressing sustainability challenges.</p>

                    <p>By forming partnerships with real companies and attending lectures on topics ranging from project management to the social implications of environmental decay, students are provided a robust and immersive semester-long experience. Whether student teams set to develop blueprints for a composting toilet or aim to maximize the energy efficiency of one of Clayton&rsquo;s small businesses, the solutions drawn up in the classroom are often implemented into real policy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lowry had developed a strong foundation of project-based work for the course, operating by the tagline of &ldquo;making the world a better place one project at a time.&rdquo; Following Lowry&rsquo;s retirement in 2019, David E. Webb and Carolyn Cosgrove-Payne have taken over as Co-Directors of the Exchange. Cosgrove and Webb have since looked to &ldquo;more directly tie the social element of sustainability&rdquo; to the course, &ldquo;and focus on what it means for us to be doing sustainability in St. Louis,&rdquo; said Cosgrove.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cosgrove and Webb understand that there are three interconnected dimensions of sustainability: Environmental, social, and economic. Webb noted that they sometimes refer to the dimensions as &ldquo;the triple bottom line, to make sure that people understand we're talking about the environment, but also the economy and often overlooked society.&rdquo; He emphasized that racial and social justice are inseparable from environmental justice, and the Exchange&rsquo;s development of sustainable solutions should likewise be rooted in mitigating racial and social inequality.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cosgrove highlighted that the Exchange places immense emphasis on rooting lectures on sustainability in racial justice, given the history of redlining and segregation in St. Louis. Environmental racism, referring to the disproportionate impact environmental hazards have on people of color, runs deep in St. Louis. Racial disparities in life expectancy and poverty can be finely traced back to the inequitable trash collection or treatment of mold between neighborhoods in St. Louis&ndash;&ndash;mapping this inequitable trash collection was a previous undertaking of the Exchange.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve incorporated class activities and lectures to address that legacy of racism and how it continues to impact the context in which we work,&rdquo; Cosgrove explained, though she added that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot of room for us to grow.&rdquo;</p>
                    
                    <p>The Exchange partners with a &ldquo;mix of on and off campus clients,&rdquo; and some of this year&rsquo;s include the city of University City, the St. Louis Zoo, a local wealth management firm and Focal Pointe Outdoor Solutions, which is responsible for all of campus landscaping. If a potential client is looking to improve sustainability of their company to any degree, they can apply to partner with the Exchange via their online forum.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cosgrove and Webb also gain a great portion of their clients and students from sheer networking. &ldquo;We just get out there on campus and talk to department chairs, faculty, and students,&rdquo; Webb said. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the course, there is no strict confinement on their potential recruits, &ldquo;we talk to anybody across campus, no matter what they study '' to accrue a range of challenging projects for students of any discipline.</p>
                    
                    <p>The course is capstone-style, offered to upperclassmen in Sam Fox, Arts and Sciences and McKelvey. Webb outlined, &ldquo;we bring together teams of students from engineering, business or art and architecture backgrounds&rdquo; to &ldquo;put their heads together;&rdquo; and apply the knowledge they&rsquo;ve obtained from two or three years of theory-based lectures. Today&rsquo;s challenges that require sustainable solutions are so complex, or &ldquo;wicked,&rdquo; meaning socially and culturally entangled, as the professors often describe, that solving them requires an immense &ldquo;diversity of perspectives.&rdquo;</p>
                    
                    <p>Theo Promlikitchai, a current senior and Environmental Policy and Psychology major in the Exchange, enrolled to &ldquo;gain the practical experience&rdquo; that many of his theory-based major-requirements lack. He is in partnership with University City to help them develop an &ldquo;updated sustainable strategic plan.&rdquo; Promlikitchai is currently focused on University City&rsquo;s transit-oriented development to &ldquo;promote active living and placemaking.&rdquo;</p>
                    
                    <p>His Tuesdays consist of lectures that inform Thursday&rsquo;s meetings with his five-person student team and the liaison from University City. Promlikitchai admitted that the beginning of the collaboration was a bit tough: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to govern a city!&rdquo; he joked, and becoming familiarized with University City&rsquo;s budget and demographic was overwhelming. He spends a great portion of his time conducting background research on University City, reading archived community-wide surveys, conducting interviews and developing and issuing his own surveys.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some of the Exchange&rsquo;s projects will span several semesters, maintained as a continuous flow of new teams contribute data. The Bird Collision Mitigation project has remained a staple of the Exchange, even amidst the pandemic. The students evaluate campus infrastructure and the style of erected buildings and ask, &ldquo;how many birds are dying because they're flying into the buildings?&rdquo;</p>
                    
                    <p>&ldquo;We have students that will get up at 7:00 in the morning and they'll walk campus to find dead birds,&rdquo; Webb said. The task seems simple, but the data is critical for preserving the biodiversity of St. Louis and limiting the unsustainable impact the University has on the greater region.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not all endeavors of the Exchange prove to be classically successful, though teams often provide their clients with valuable insight nonetheless. In the case of one team&rsquo;s attempt to perform water analysis of a watershed, the students discovered the set of tools being used were inadequate: &ldquo;on one hand, the project really wasn't successful, as the client didn't get the watershed analysis that they were looking for. But on the other hand, the client learned, as did we, that that particular set of tools and technologies were never appropriate.&rdquo; The students spared their client from the continued waste of time, money, and resources, which is a sustainable contribution in itself.</p>
                    
                    <p>Though the pandemic has impeded on the rate and ease of collaboration between the Exchange&rsquo;s students and client, Webb noted it has brought mainstream attention to pertinent (and historically overlooked) issues regarding biodiversity.</p>
                    
                    <p>&ldquo;If you look at COVID-19, it is said to have emerged in wet markets in Wuhan, China,&rdquo; Webb said. &ldquo;Other viruses like this have their zoonotic viruses have emerged where we've had contact with bats, or other animals; a lot of that is the result of us humans encroaching on the environment.&rdquo;</p>
                    
                    <p>Webb is unsure of the specific impact this newfound environmental awareness will have, but knows &ldquo;there's an opportunity going forward&rdquo; and that invites continued studying of biodiversity with a stressed importance on maintaining natural habitats and ecosystems. The more we encroach on ecosystems, the more we increase the likelihood of future COVID-19-like events.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Throughout the month of March, several teams made up of members of the University community committed to a more environmentally-conscious lifestyle in a modified version of the annual Green Cup.</p>

                    <p>Rather than monitoring energy consumption, this year&rsquo;s Green Cup was largely centered around the Campus Ecochallenge platform, which allows participants to set and track sustainability goals. In addition, participants could earn points by taking weekly sustainability quizzes and posting on social media.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;In the past, a big part of Green Cup has been the energy production in the dorms,&rdquo; Washington University Green Ambassador senior Amy An said. &ldquo;Now that things are virtual and students are all over the place, we wanted to make sure that everyone, regardless of where they are studying, had an opportunity to participate.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Marla Guggenheimer, a MSW candidate at the Brown School and an engagement specialist for the Office of Sustainability, played a large role in planning the 2021 Green Cup.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t really know at all what the turnout was going to be...and we opened up the participation to really anyone, so it didn&rsquo;t just have to be Wash. U. students on campus&mdash;it could be students and family members of students and anybody who wanted to participate,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Although only 63 individuals ended up taking on the challenge, Guggenheimer said she was impressed by the level of commitment and enthusiasm among participants.</p>

                    <p>One major change to 2021&rsquo;s program that likely impacted turnout was that participants formed their own teams. In prior years, teams have been based off of residential colleges.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was really good to see especially a lot of first year engagement, people making their own groups, even some residential colleges who were like, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re just going to participate as a dorm,&rsquo;&rdquo; WashU Green Ambassador sophomore Maya Tsingos said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been less than in previous years just because of the circumstances, but still really impressive how people have stepped up and adjusted to this new format.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Freshman Ellis Wu recruited friends from his rowing team and the Pathfinder Fellows Program to form a 20-person team called &ldquo;Birds Aren&rsquo;t Real.&rdquo; As of March 31, the team was ranked number 38 out of 552 Campus Ecochallenge teams nationwide, and was in the lead among teams from Washington University. Wu personally earned more than 1500 points for his team by completing a series of daily challenges such as limiting showers to 5 minutes and using reusable water bottles, as well as completing one-time tasks like installing a low-flow showerhead and researching local waste sites.</p>

                    <p>In addition to focusing on more typical sustainability practices, the Campus Ecochallenge also encourages participants to take care of their own physical health. Wu committed to exercising and biking daily.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;The entire crew team bikes to practice every morning, which is cool,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>In shifting away from measuring energy consumption in the dorms, the 2021 Green Cup was able to significantly broaden its scope.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;The focus isn&rsquo;t so much on only energy reduction&mdash;while that&rsquo;s still a huge piece of it, there&rsquo;s also so many other aspects of sustainability that students can now focus,&rdquo; Guggenheimer said. &ldquo;The Campus Ecochallenge platform really opens the conversation up to not just food, transportation, waste and energy use, but is also about reflection and time in nature and time away from screens and you can tailor it to your own habits that you want to form.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Tsingos, who also serves as the sustainability chair for the Congress of the South 40, applauded the variety of options for students to choose from.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;For example, I can be like, &lsquo;I will watch one documentary about food waste this week and I will learn more about environmental racism in my community,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s smaller things, of course, like I&rsquo;ll bring my own water bottle, I&rsquo;ll bring my own bag when I go grocery shopping, I&rsquo;ll turn off all the lights&mdash;things that hopefully will stay with you past the end of Green Cup.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Tsingos said that Green Cup had been an opportunity for her to go beyond small daily actions to delve deeper into the broader picture of sustainability in the United States.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really interesting to learn more about how different power dynamics affect sustainability, and really look at getting involved in the community [and] how the government affects sustainable practices,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to keep learning more about those bigger picture dynamics to see how I fit into those as an individual.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>An encouraged students to take the time to educate themselves about sustainability and potential environmentally-friendly lifestyle changes, pointing out the severe consequences of climate change.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;When there are lots of climate repercussions like natural disasters [and] food insecurity, at that point it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; An said. &ldquo;This is an issue that needs to be addressed before we see those large repercussions. And I think a lot of us at Wash. U. are fortunate that we don&rsquo;t have to necessarily be thinking about this and also fortunate that we&rsquo;re in a position to take action about it, so I think it&rsquo;s very important that students be aware of how their actions could be changed to be more sustainable.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Both Wu and Tsingos emphasized the importance of taking individual action and not becoming discouraged.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Oftentimes people get the notion that your individual actions aren&rsquo;t of concern, because they statistically won&rsquo;t make that much of a difference but...even if you&rsquo;re making a tiny change, you&rsquo;re promoting certain ideals within your community, and perhaps other people can take hold of your ideas as well and sort of jump off of where you start,&rdquo; Wu said.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Even though people may be disillusioned or disenchanted with the idea of sustainability, [thinking] &lsquo;What can I do as an individual,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s really as a community that we make changes,&rdquo; Tsingos said. &ldquo;If all of the first year class become interested in this topic, then we can make changes on campus, we can make changes in the city, we can make changes together.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Although the Green Cup has drawn to a close, An said that she plans to continue working towards the same goals she set during the challenge.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Green Cup is a one month long challenge, but I always like to think of it as just a reminder, just a starting point for continuing to be sustainable all the time,&rdquo; An said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reminder and an opportunity to make new goals for myself, and I'm going to carry that forward beyond the month of March, and I hope that people who participated in Green Cup will do the same.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>When walking around the Village, it&rsquo;s not unusual to see trash cans overflowing with to-go containers. The later in the day it is, the more of these white boxes you can find crumpled into, stacked above or even scattered around the landfill bins. The issue here is not the size of the landfill bin, or the amount of trash cans, or the dimensions of the containers. It&rsquo;s that these small white boxes are compostable&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t belong in the landfill. But you&rsquo;re practically guaranteed to see one of these overflowing trash cans with just a brief walk outside of the Village&rsquo;s dining area.</p>

                    <p>While the Village does have an indoor compost bin, the area outside of the Village&ndash;&ndash;where both underclassmen and upperclassmen can be found dining, especially as the weather gets warmer&ndash;&ndash;lacks compost bins. After enjoying a meal outside, most students simply throw their compostable to-go container in the landfill bin&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the most accessible and doesn&rsquo;t require going back inside the dining area.</p>

                    <p>Outdoor compost bins already exist on campus. Just look right outside of Bear&rsquo;s Den, where a row of recycling, landfill, and compost bins are situated. Setting up more outdoor compost bins around campus&ndash;&ndash;not just at the Village&ndash;&ndash;could help solve the problem of trash cans filled with containers that should have been composted.</p>

                    <p>While Wash. U. can do its part by adding more compost bins, the responsibility ultimately comes down to individuals. As busy and sleep-deprived students, we have the tendency to choose the easiest&ndash;&ndash;and often laziest&ndash;&ndash;route. Shoving a compostable container in the landfill rather than going back inside to put it in the compost bin is enticing. Sure, it might save a few seconds, maybe a minute. We&rsquo;re all guilty of doing it. But if we all choose to be more aware of where we dispose of our compostable containers, the overflowing landfill bins could become a rare sight.</p>

                    <p>So why all this hubbub about the humble compost bin? For most people, especially city dwellers, recycling is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about sustainability. Now, this is not to disparage recycling&mdash;on the whole it is a productive trend in society, reducing energy use and waste. However, recycling is an exceedingly complex process that has been beset with issues for years. The United States has long exported recycling to China, yet in recent years <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/recycling-rethink-what-to-do-with-trash-now-china-wont-take-it-11576776536" target="_blank">China has started to refuse shipments</a>. Simply put, recycling is expensive, and it&rsquo;s all about the money these days. It should not be abandoned, and promising improvements are being made, but it certainly should not be our sole focus.</p>

                    <p>An estimated <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertilizers" target="_blank">40 percent of the world</a> is fed on agricultural products that depend on synthetic fertilizer. Indeed the invention of synthetic fertilizers has helped to avert global famine in the last century. And yet, there are huge downsides&mdash;synthetic fertilizers are often sourced in fossil fuels and <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10120269" target="_blank">require huge energy input</a>. In addition, most synthetic fertilizers are water soluble, leading to water table pollution and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fertilizers-harm-earth/" target="_blank">disruption of aquatic environments</a>.</p>

                    <p>Compost is our cure&mdash;a solution to large waste pilups, a partial solution to recycling waste issues, and to the potential future famine, as agricultural output struggles to match the rapidly growing population in a world ravaged by the climate crisis.</p>

                    <p>Composting is exceedingly simple&mdash;if you throw your food on some dirt, it will rot away. Microbes, fungi, and protists in the soil take care of the rest. It is nature&rsquo;s recycling, and as so often is the case, nature is much better at it than we are. There are no landfills in a forest: when something falls to the forest floor it is consumed and reincorporated into the soil. There is no reason to abandon this reuse cycle, tested for eons before humanity emerged.</p>

                    <p>Finished compost has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home" target="_blank">many benefits in comparison to synthetic fertilizer</a>&mdash;a soil microbiome, better soil structure, and a more complete micronutrient problem. Removing compostable material from anaerobic environments in landfills into aerobic composting facilities reduces methane emissions. It can even improve recycling&mdash;by encouraging people to remove organic waste from recycling bins, composting makes recycling easier. Without the added cost of removing organic waste from recycling, China might still be accepting shipments of recycling from america.</p>

                    <p>And there is so much potential for composting&mdash;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/sustainable-management-food-basics" target="_blank">more than 20 percent of landfill waste</a> is food material (this does not include compostable paper and yard trimmings). But this is not waste&mdash;this is potential fertility that is being wasted.</p>

                    <p>It can be hard to find the motivation to be environmentally friendly when the most significant determinants of our climate stem from forces outside of our control. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change" target="_blank">The globe&rsquo;s biggest corporations continue to ruin the environment and perpetuate climate change</a>. In comparison, a few white boxes in a trash seem understandably insignificant. But composting is something that we can control. When we finish our meal, we make the decision whether or not to compost our leftovers. That extra second it takes to put a compostable container where it belongs can make all the difference.</p>

                    <p>The planet is in some pretty dire straits right now, and we should not be ignoring any way that we can help. Lots of people will tell you how inefficient or counterproductive recycling is, so now you have something to counter that&mdash;just add compost!</p>

                    <p>Watching one of the shows put on by the Washington University Performing Arts Department is always a stunning experience. There are huge sets, beautiful costumes. Everything seems so tailor-made to each show that it&rsquo;s hard to believe most things are reused. And yet reuse and recycling is an ingrained part of the department.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s not coming from being environmentally conscious. That&rsquo;s just how theater is done, Rob Morgan, a theatrical designer and teaching professor in the PAD, explained.</p>

                    <p>He described being a child and playing with an empty roll of aluminum foil. We know what the cardboard tube was originally used for, but the child&rsquo;s creativity finds a million other ways to use it. Designing for theater, he said, uses that same creativity.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;I see it as recycling from life, essentially, in the theater world. Putting something onstage is about repurposing materials. And I will admit that onstage, it&rsquo;s often about trying to make use of what is often a very tiny budget,&rdquo; Morgan said.</p>

                    <p>Sean Savoie, Lighting Designer and Production Manager, agreed, but added that the creativity is necessary for more reasons than one.  &ldquo;For our own benefit, from a humanity standpoint but also just being fiscally responsible, we try to be sustainable, sometimes without thinking about it,&rdquo; Savoie said. &ldquo;&#8230;I think inherently there is a sustainability to our industry that&rsquo;s just there. It&rsquo;s underneath everything. It&rsquo;s not something anybody went out of their way to do, but it&rsquo;s just us, it&rsquo;s how we live and how we do our craft.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>That theme of fiscal responsibility came up constantly -- the PAD does not have unlimited resources. Bill Whitaker, chair of the production committee, phrased it best: &ldquo;it may not be perceived by some as the most critical of studies.&rdquo; That means a smaller budget, which means creative reuse of materials is a necessity.</p>

                    <p>Of course, reuse is not the only thing the Department does to be environmentally friendly. Savioe pointed to the transition over the last decade to LED lighting, which cut down energy consumption drastically. He also noted that they try to use paints with fewer toxic chemicals.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite done yet, we&rsquo;re still getting there in terms of a really green output, but it&rsquo;s heading in a really good direction right now,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>Still, reuse makes up a huge part of the department&rsquo;s practice. That doesn&rsquo;t just mean using things that have been in previous PAD shows, though that is common. Whitaker noted that even without being involved with scene or props, he will often see something he remembers using in a previous show.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;As a director, I can&rsquo;t tell you how many shows in my plus-25 years here where I&rsquo;ve gone, &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s that sofa. Oh, that is the fabric we used in &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; that we used eight years ago,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We end up making do, honestly, with what we can find,&rdquo; Morgan explained. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s already a bit of recycling of things that otherwise people, other companies would see as trash, we really see as something we can utilize.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>That recycling can come from anywhere. Morgan described a production of &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rdquo; he was involved with several years ago. In order to create roof tile for the show&rsquo;s Italian set, he and the design team dumpster-dove and retrieved carpet tubes which they cut and repainted for the purpose. Though the show was at The Muny in Forest Park, not Wash. U., he said the same practices are often used.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s not always dumpster diving, though. Other materials can come from partnerships with other theaters or businesses in town. One architectural salvage, Morgan said, lets the PAD borrow doors for their sets. Other times, Savoie said, they get things from Restore, a business that sells used construction materials.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to share our resources quite nicely [with our colleagues]...So that way we&rsquo;re not building, we&rsquo;re not wasting, we&rsquo;re not throwing away. It&rsquo;s a good camaraderie that we benefit from,&rdquo; Savoie said.</p>

                    <p>This year, the pandemic made this harder. Businesses temporarily closed; theaters largely shut down. Shows this year are smaller and use fewer resources. That makes for an entirely different experience of theater.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Being forced outside and online, I believe we had a smaller ecological footprint than we did previously,&rdquo; Department Chair Pannil Camp wrote in an email to Student Life. &ldquo;That said, even under normal operations, we are careful to recycle and reuse materials like costumes and plywood.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>It has been a difficult year for theater. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the performing arts suffered tremendous job loss over the pandemic&rsquo;s first year. The Wash. U. performing arts department is still going strong, however. This year&rsquo;s season, On Moving Ground, has adapted to the ever-changing world and continued to present theater, albeit in virtual and otherwise distanced formats.</p>

                    <p>Those have included recorded theater, such as &ldquo;Focus,&rdquo; which went live in early March, and &ldquo;Homecoming Voices,&rdquo; available in April. These shows aren&rsquo;t like your typical theater. They&rsquo;re shorter and use significantly fewer props and actors. They&rsquo;re also shows that take advantage of being filmed. Savoie noted how different designing a show for the camera is -- lights and scenery are altered to prioritize the singular eye of the camera over a live show&rsquo;s hundreds of audience members.</p>

                    <p>Pandemic theater also presents its own restrictions. Actors can&rsquo;t get close together, resulting in some shows having only one or two cast members. That distance, both among the cast and crew members and the audience, makes a huge difference. Morgan, for one, doesn&rsquo;t think recorded shows will stick around post-pandemic. The audience and their energy is what makes theater, he said.</p>

                    <p>Savoie agreed. &ldquo;People are such a vital component of what we do, having live response. It&rsquo;s kind of creepy and eerie when you land a line that&rsquo;s supposed to have laughter and it just falls. There&rsquo;s nothing there.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Still, recorded theater has to stick around for a while; the PAD hasn&rsquo;t even released all of this season&rsquo;s recorded content. And despite the stark difference between a recorded and live show, Whitaker said he&rsquo;s glad Wash. U. didn&rsquo;t put a pause on this kind of entertainment.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a kind of refresher course on what we can do even when we don&rsquo;t have full-time resources,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>Currently, the department is preparing for their first live show since early 2020. &ldquo;COVID Mysteries&rdquo; will be an outdoor show, an adaptation of the medieval York Cycle Mystery Plays to the modern day on their very own pageant wagon.</p>

                    <p>That reintroduction of live theater is very exciting.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve missed until you see it again,&rdquo; Morgan said. &ldquo;I feel like we&rsquo;re at that stage now in the pandemic, we&rsquo;re often struck by what was an assumption or an expectation or something we just took for granted. Those little things are much more important now.&rdquo; Live theater, he says, is one of those things.</p>

                    <p>Whitaker echoed the sentiment. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s lemonade in the lemons of COVID&#8230;This wagon, when we thought about it, we initially thought about it like a show like we always do, budget it, build it, break it down. But then we thought, &lsquo;What if this were again and again and again?&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The wagon, which will bring &ldquo;COVID Mysteries&rdquo; to a live student audience on Mudd Field in early April, comes as many across the country receive their vaccine. We&rsquo;re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean this will be the only show the wagon presents. &ldquo;The wagon has been built in a way that it can last. Not one show, not two, but it&rsquo;s buying a little baby theater that we hope can continue and make it out of this difficult time,&rdquo; Whitaker said.</p>

                    <p>Whether that use is from the PAD or student theater groups, the department has high hopes for the pageant wagon.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Our hope is that this wagon becomes literally and figuratively a vehicle for many more performances to come,&rdquo; Morgan said. &ldquo;&#8230;We&rsquo;re trying to prep it as much as we can for a lengthy use.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>That reuse is emblematic of the Performing Arts Department. It&rsquo;s not done to be environmentally friendly, that&rsquo;s just the best way to run the program.</p>

                    <p>Morgan described what he called a &lsquo;green show,&rsquo; a concept where every part of a show uses reused or recycled materials. The constraints of the green show really stimulate creativity -- he described one green show he worked on in grad school where costumes incorporated things like reused bubble wrap.</p>

                    <p>That&rsquo;s not something Wash. U. does, he said, but even if it was, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t make much difference.</p>

                    <p>Savioe, who wasn&rsquo;t familiar with green shows, agreed it is something Wash. U. is capable of.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great idea, and it seems like something that probably could be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;...Is it something that can be applied for every show? Probably not. But given the script and approach, I&rsquo;m a firm believer that anything&rsquo;s possible. You can do anything you want as long as you can find a creative way to get to it.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>With the amount of creative reuse and repurposing that already goes into PAD shows, a green show doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a stretch.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Maybe we should look into that category, but it&rsquo;s kind of baked into the cake quite often,&rdquo; Morgan said.</p>                </div>

                    <p>You may have noticed the East End transformation and Forest Park Parkway Bridge Replacement. But you may have not noticed the 3,800 added bike parking spaces or the addition of 2.5 miles of separated bike lanes on and around campus. It&rsquo;s the big and little things that have contributed to Washington University being recognized as a 2021 Gold-Level Bicycle University by the League of American Bicyclists.</p>

                    <p>At a school where 30% of the population commutes by bike, according to the 2016 Mobility Survey, creating a biking culture is about more than just shortening students' travel time from the Umrath dorms to Seigle Hall. It is about developing a more sustainable Wash. U.</p>

                    <p>In 2011, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Sustainability Phil Valko joined the University. The Centennial Greenway had just been completed in partnership with Green Rivers Greenway, a St. Louis public agency that seeks to connect the city by developing a regional network of greenways. The route runs from Forest Park through the Wash. U. campus to the Delmar Loop. The success of the Greenway established St. Louis as a bicycle-friendly city and launched the push for Wash. U. to become a bicycle-friendly university, Valko explained.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Transportation is a significant contributor of emissions here in the St. Louis region,&rdquo; Valko said. &ldquo;Having a good strategy to get people to campus safely and enjoyably on bike and on foot is critical to reducing our emissions.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Biking is a form of zero-emission transportation. When people choose to bike rather than drive a car, they prevent greenhouse gas emissions and preserve air quality. There are several incentives for the University to increase its support for cyclists. It keeps students and faculty active, reduces emissions and takes pressure away from the University&rsquo;s parking infrastructure, Valko said.</p>

                    <p>The process to identify Wash. U. as a Bicycle Friendly University was not easy. Ten people from several departments worked on the University&rsquo;s 41-page application to the League of American Bicyclists.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;A lot of time and effort went into making sure that what we were saying in the application was correct, documenting the programs we've hosted the outcomes of those programs, infrastructure that's been built, and data and usage,&rdquo; acknowledged Valko. &ldquo;It's like a big paper. They need to make sure that we&rsquo;ve vetted all of our sources.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Wash. U.&rsquo;s Gold-level recognition comes after being designated as a Bicycle Friendly University in 2015 at the Bronze level, and then at the Silver level in 2017. Beyond changes in infrastructure, there has been an increase in programming and events held specifically to accommodate bikers.</p>

                    <p>Alternative Transportation Coordinator Becca Gilberg works on outreach and programming to foster the growing biking culture on campus. One recent project is the new bike registration policy with Project 529. Under this free program, any Danforth student can register their bike to a national database which can greatly increase the chances of retrieving their bike if it gets lost or stolen.</p>

                    <p>Gilberg&rsquo;s upcoming focus is WashU Rides, a commuter platform that connects bikers who want to form a bike pool for increased safety and a sense of community. The interface has an interactive map that logs the user&rsquo;s commute, CO2 reduction, calories burned and money saved via alternative transportation.</p>

                    <p>Looking towards the future, Wash. U. is making conscious efforts to ensure that the University promotes sustainability by advocating for a bike-friendly campus. In partnering with Green Rivers Greenway, the University hopes to integrate the campus with its neighboring municipalities.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Building infrastructure that connects into North and South neighborhoods, particularly North, which tends to be very underserved, is a big opportunity area for us,&rdquo; said Valko. &ldquo;The successes of the University have become broader successes within the community and the neighborhoods that surround us.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Wash. U. will receive a recommendation report from the League of American Bicyclists with proposed actions to improve its campus accessibility for cyclists. Wash. U. staff continue to work towards developing a safe and sustainable biking culture on campus.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;There are all these little things that no one notices unless you start talking about it,&rdquo; Gilberg said. &ldquo;There's just so much that goes into it that I never would have considered if I wasn't part of this, it's pretty incredible. And it takes a lot of people at Wash. U. to do it.&rdquo;</p>
                
                    <p class="note">Alternative Transportation Coordinator Becca Gilberg is looking for feedback on how to improve programming and events for biking on campus. You can reach out to her at rgilberg@wustl.edu.</p>
