                    <p>Washington University&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability released updates on their five-year plan from 2015 that reveal significant progress toward more sustainable operations, March 16.</p>

                    <p>The strategic plan was broken into eight key areas: energy and emissions, landscape, water, transportation, food, community, buildings and waste. Progress updates for six of these areas are available to the public, while the buildings and waste updates have yet to be posted.</p>

                    <p>The goals for the water objectives were marked as achieved, transportation goals were achieved, one objective was met in the area of food while two are &ldquo;in progress,&rdquo; community objectives were achieved, energy and emissions goals are currently &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; and the goals of landscape are half achieved and half &ldquo;on track.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>This is the second strategic plan for sustainable operations by the University after the first was created through a collaboration of students, faculty and staff in 2010.</p>

                    <p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Sustainability Phil Valko, said that the 2015 plan&rsquo;s ambition fueled much of the drive to accomplish the goals.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We really have made pretty meaningful progress, so I'm proud of actually the whole portfolio of work,&rdquo; Valko said. &ldquo;In 2015 when we published that &lsquo;15 to &lsquo;20 plan, we were being really ambitious and&#8230; that ambition, I think, paid off.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>According to Valko, some notable areas of improvement include five recent LEED certifications for buildings, the expansion of the student internship program, success with local food sourcing and the reduction of turf and performative landscape across campus, specifically the major green transformation of the East End.</p>

                    <p>One specific long-term goal the University set for sustainability standards in the 2010 plan was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The 2015 plan built upon the 2010 objectives to continue on this path. Hank Webber, Executive Vice Chancellor for Civic Affairs and Strategic Planning, said at the &ldquo;Wednesdays with WashU: Climate Action at WashU&rdquo; seminar that this ten-year goal has nearly been met.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;That does not sound like, nor is it a terribly ambitious goal, until you realize that we have doubled our square footage&#8230;and most of the emissions at Washington University come from&#8230;our physical footprint,&rdquo; Webber said. &ldquo;We are 98% of the way there as of 2020, and we will be 102% of the way there by 2021.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, another goal of the 2015 plan was to pursue renewable energy projects. In 2015, the first major sustainability project was to install solar panels on University-owned property. This was expanded upon in 2019 with a &ldquo;new $3.5 million solar photovoltaic project on the Danforth, Medical and North campuses.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Today, the University generates 2.5 megawatts of solar power, making it one of the largest consumers of on-site solar energy in the St. Louis area,&rdquo; the 2015 plan updates read.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, to achieve the sustainability goals outlined in the most recent plan, the University has made investments across campus operations. Many of these investments have also been profitable, with the largest profits coming from metering and retro-commissioning. Both metering and retro-commissioning work to quickly identify and correct energy inefficiencies.</p>

                    <p>Metering allows the University to collect data on the usage of electricity, hot water for heating, cold water for cooling and natural gas. Although there used to be only three meters on the Danforth campus, there are now 500.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;This cost $3 million on the Danforth campus and a similar amount in the medical school, and it was the best investment we ever made,&rdquo; Webber said.</p>

                    <p>Similarly, retro-commissioning involves analyzing building operations and making sure the systems are operating as efficiently as possible, which has proved effective on campus buildings. For example, retro-commissioning of just McDonnell Hall resulted in a 28% overall reduction in energy use and will save 938 metric tons of CO2 annually, according to data presented at the webinar.</p>

                    <p>The investments in energy conservation projects across campus enable the University to operate at a high level of efficiency, leading to both financial and environmental savings.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We have invested on the order of $50 million in an extensive set of energy conservation projects in our existing buildings,&rdquo; Webber said. &ldquo;We have a very formal economic model of net present value, but over a period of a maximum of eight or so years, these projects all pay for themselves...What's good for the planet is also good for the resources of the University,&rdquo; Webber added.</p>

                    <p>Alexis Tinoco, Geographical Information Systems Specialist Intern said that energy usage is the area that he would like to see substantively addressed in the next sustainability plan. According to Valko, this was one of the most challenging aspects of the 2015 plan in the area of carbon reduction and energy conservation.</p>

                    <p> &ldquo;I would really love to see some more ambitious goals respective to our energy usage,&rdquo; Tinoco wrote in a statement to Student Life. &ldquo;Specifically, I am eager to see the University commit to a carbon neutrality plan such as many peer institutions have already done.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Junior Mandy Huang, Strategic Planning Research and Coordination Associate, said the next plan should focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) should be central to strategic planning and I would love to see more concrete and measurable goals included in our University's and OOS's next iteration of Strategic Plans,&rdquo; Huang said, noting she was proud that Washington University was one of few schools to include a specific DEI hiring goal in their 2015 plan.</p>

                    <p>Tinoco also said that he hopes the University can be even more ambitious in addressing climate change for the entire St. Louis region, specifically by divesting from fossil fuels.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Wash. U.&rsquo;s impact stretches beyond the University community and it is imperative that the institution adopt a more aggressive plan to combat climate change,&rdquo; Tinoco said. &ldquo;The push for divestment has gained traction within the Wash. U. community over the years and it&rsquo;s time the administration hear the community&rsquo;s concerns.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Though there have been no indications that the University plans to fully divest from fossil fuels soon, a broader commitment to the St. Louis region could be realized in the form of local carbon offsets&mdash;a strategy Valko noted may be utilized by the University to create a pathway to carbon neutrality.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We're evaluating what carbon offsets would look like for the University&#8230;perhaps there's an opportunity to invest in energy efficiency projects here in the St Louis region in low income households so that the offsets&#8230;they help our local neighbors and that really ties into Chancellor Martin's vision of Wash. U. in St. Louis, for St. Louis,&rdquo; Valko said.</p>

                    <p>Huang said she would like to see the University adopt the carbon neutrality resolution passed by SU last year, making the community &ldquo;carbon neutral by 2035 or before and in alignment with the 100% renewable energy goal of the City of St. Louis or earlier.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The next strategic plan for sustainable operations is beginning to form under the University&rsquo;s wider strategic planning process, Valko said. Studies are also currently underway to help guide the ambitious goal-setting. As for a specific timeline for carbon neutrality, Webber said that a likely trajectory was 15 years.</p>

                    <p>Now that winter has come to an end, Missouri officials and the Division of Energy are having to reflect on their energy plans in response to an unexpectedly rough winter. <a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/historic-cold-snap-breaking-several-kansas-city-records/" target="_blank">Recent winters have not compared to this one</a> in terms of snow, ice, and temperature, and it has led Missouri to recognize how underprepared we are in our energy use and composition. On Feb. 13, around the beginning of the snowstorm conundrum, <a href="https://www.whiteriver.org/press_release/peak-alert-issued-in-extreme-weather-conditions/" target="_blank">many local electric cooperatives</a> in Missouri <a href="https://www.midamericanenergy.com/peak-alerts" target="_blank">issued a &ldquo;peak alert&rdquo;</a> which is when electricity usage is in peak demand, and the cooperatives may not have enough supply. This is usually announced to urge people to lower their thermostats, use less electricity and conserve other natural gases in their homes, because doing so creates a large demand for natural gases and overwhelms the market price of energy units. According to <a href="https://www.cityutilities.net/blackouts/" target="_blank">Springfield&rsquo;s City Utilities</a>, a dekatherm (<a href="https://www.cgcohio.com/faqs/what-dekatherm-dth" target="_blank">unit of measuring heat value of natural gas</a>) of nonrenewable natural gas went from a market price of $3.00 to nearly $400. Missouri isn&rsquo;t one of the top producers of coal, so in outages like those seen during February, the exorbitant coal market is the only backup for purchasing energy. This raised Missourians&rsquo; electricity bill an extreme amount and left many with cold homes and power outages.</p>

                    <p>Missouri is too reliant on coal, and this has resulted in a number of problems in recent years. In 2018, 73% of our <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/with-coals-dominance-in-missouri-prospects-of-clean-energy-transition-remain-uncertain/article_81b48f73-8b1c-59cc-8571-86e18576edec.html" target="_blank">energy was generated by coal, and only 6% was renewable</a>. While many other surrounding states have converted to a clean energy plan, Missouri has continually denied any advancement in this direction. There have been many efforts to shut down coal power plants, which is a step in the right direction, but in Missouri as well as other states across the nation, they have been replaced with fracking. Fracking has many awful side effects as well including pollution of water, soil and air.</p>

                    <p>It is also a common misconception that there can be &ldquo;clean&rdquo; natural resources. While it&rsquo;s true that some natural gases emit less carbon dioxide, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/natural-gas-and-the-environment.php" target="_blank">in recent years</a>, we have come to discover that the &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; of natural gases aren&rsquo;t really much better than any other fossil fuel like coal. In the process of mining for natural gases, methane is released in addition to many other pollutants. So, at best, they are &ldquo;less dirty,&rdquo; but not clean enough to be considered environmentally friendly.</p>

                    <p>While it may be cheaper for Missourians to use coal as the primary energy source, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a much larger problem looming over the state. It is even scarier to think about how much we rely on coal to power our state. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-oil-left-earth-2017-12-27" target="_blank">Worse, in 2014, studies estimated that the world had about 53 years worth of oil left</a>. If those numbers still hold true, that would leave us with about 47 years left. With a rising global awareness of carbon footprints, Missouri continues to drag down any progress surrounding states have made. The U.S. uses exponentially more oil than any other country in the world, and with the fracking boom, I can only imagine the consequences. With a state that is about five times smaller in population than Texas but consumes nearly two thirds the amount of coal that Texas uses, it is undoubtedly an issue that our officials are intentionally ignoring.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the month of March, several teams made up of members of the University community committed to a more environmentally-conscious lifestyle in a modified version of the annual Green Cup.</p>

                    <p>Rather than monitoring energy consumption, this year&rsquo;s Green Cup was largely centered around the Campus Ecochallenge platform, which allows participants to set and track sustainability goals. In addition, participants could earn points by taking weekly sustainability quizzes and posting on social media.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;In the past, a big part of Green Cup has been the energy production in the dorms,&rdquo; Washington University Green Ambassador senior Amy An said. &ldquo;Now that things are virtual and students are all over the place, we wanted to make sure that everyone, regardless of where they are studying, had an opportunity to participate.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Marla Guggenheimer, a MSW candidate at the Brown School and an engagement specialist for the Office of Sustainability, played a large role in planning the 2021 Green Cup.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t really know at all what the turnout was going to be...and we opened up the participation to really anyone, so it didn&rsquo;t just have to be Wash. U. students on campus&mdash;it could be students and family members of students and anybody who wanted to participate,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Although only 63 individuals ended up taking on the challenge, Guggenheimer said she was impressed by the level of commitment and enthusiasm among participants.</p>

                    <p>One major change to 2021&rsquo;s program that likely impacted turnout was that participants formed their own teams. In prior years, teams have been based off of residential colleges.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was really good to see especially a lot of first year engagement, people making their own groups, even some residential colleges who were like, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re just going to participate as a dorm,&rsquo;&rdquo; WashU Green Ambassador sophomore Maya Tsingos said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been less than in previous years just because of the circumstances, but still really impressive how people have stepped up and adjusted to this new format.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Freshman Ellis Wu recruited friends from his rowing team and the Pathfinder Fellows Program to form a 20-person team called &ldquo;Birds Aren&rsquo;t Real.&rdquo; As of March 31, the team was ranked number 38 out of 552 Campus Ecochallenge teams nationwide, and was in the lead among teams from Washington University. Wu personally earned more than 1500 points for his team by completing a series of daily challenges such as limiting showers to 5 minutes and using reusable water bottles, as well as completing one-time tasks like installing a low-flow showerhead and researching local waste sites.</p>

                    <p>In addition to focusing on more typical sustainability practices, the Campus Ecochallenge also encourages participants to take care of their own physical health. Wu committed to exercising and biking daily.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;The entire crew team bikes to practice every morning, which is cool,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>In shifting away from measuring energy consumption in the dorms, the 2021 Green Cup was able to significantly broaden its scope.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;The focus isn&rsquo;t so much on only energy reduction&mdash;while that&rsquo;s still a huge piece of it, there&rsquo;s also so many other aspects of sustainability that students can now focus,&rdquo; Guggenheimer said. &ldquo;The Campus Ecochallenge platform really opens the conversation up to not just food, transportation, waste and energy use, but is also about reflection and time in nature and time away from screens and you can tailor it to your own habits that you want to form.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Tsingos, who also serves as the sustainability chair for the Congress of the South 40, applauded the variety of options for students to choose from.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;For example, I can be like, &lsquo;I will watch one documentary about food waste this week and I will learn more about environmental racism in my community,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s smaller things, of course, like I&rsquo;ll bring my own water bottle, I&rsquo;ll bring my own bag when I go grocery shopping, I&rsquo;ll turn off all the lights&mdash;things that hopefully will stay with you past the end of Green Cup.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Tsingos said that Green Cup had been an opportunity for her to go beyond small daily actions to delve deeper into the broader picture of sustainability in the United States.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really interesting to learn more about how different power dynamics affect sustainability, and really look at getting involved in the community [and] how the government affects sustainable practices,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to keep learning more about those bigger picture dynamics to see how I fit into those as an individual.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>An encouraged students to take the time to educate themselves about sustainability and potential environmentally-friendly lifestyle changes, pointing out the severe consequences of climate change.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;When there are lots of climate repercussions like natural disasters [and] food insecurity, at that point it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; An said. &ldquo;This is an issue that needs to be addressed before we see those large repercussions. And I think a lot of us at Wash. U. are fortunate that we don&rsquo;t have to necessarily be thinking about this and also fortunate that we&rsquo;re in a position to take action about it, so I think it&rsquo;s very important that students be aware of how their actions could be changed to be more sustainable.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Both Wu and Tsingos emphasized the importance of taking individual action and not becoming discouraged.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Oftentimes people get the notion that your individual actions aren&rsquo;t of concern, because they statistically won&rsquo;t make that much of a difference but...even if you&rsquo;re making a tiny change, you&rsquo;re promoting certain ideals within your community, and perhaps other people can take hold of your ideas as well and sort of jump off of where you start,&rdquo; Wu said.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Even though people may be disillusioned or disenchanted with the idea of sustainability, [thinking] &lsquo;What can I do as an individual,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s really as a community that we make changes,&rdquo; Tsingos said. &ldquo;If all of the first year class become interested in this topic, then we can make changes on campus, we can make changes in the city, we can make changes together.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Although the Green Cup has drawn to a close, An said that she plans to continue working towards the same goals she set during the challenge.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Green Cup is a one month long challenge, but I always like to think of it as just a reminder, just a starting point for continuing to be sustainable all the time,&rdquo; An said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reminder and an opportunity to make new goals for myself, and I'm going to carry that forward beyond the month of March, and I hope that people who participated in Green Cup will do the same.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>When walking around the Village, it&rsquo;s not unusual to see trash cans overflowing with to-go containers. The later in the day it is, the more of these white boxes you can find crumpled into, stacked above or even scattered around the landfill bins. The issue here is not the size of the landfill bin, or the amount of trash cans, or the dimensions of the containers. It&rsquo;s that these small white boxes are compostable&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t belong in the landfill. But you&rsquo;re practically guaranteed to see one of these overflowing trash cans with just a brief walk outside of the Village&rsquo;s dining area.</p>

                    <p>While the Village does have an indoor compost bin, the area outside of the Village&ndash;&ndash;where both underclassmen and upperclassmen can be found dining, especially as the weather gets warmer&ndash;&ndash;lacks compost bins. After enjoying a meal outside, most students simply throw their compostable to-go container in the landfill bin&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the most accessible and doesn&rsquo;t require going back inside the dining area.</p>

                    <p>Outdoor compost bins already exist on campus. Just look right outside of Bear&rsquo;s Den, where a row of recycling, landfill, and compost bins are situated. Setting up more outdoor compost bins around campus&ndash;&ndash;not just at the Village&ndash;&ndash;could help solve the problem of trash cans filled with containers that should have been composted.</p>

                    <p>While Wash. U. can do its part by adding more compost bins, the responsibility ultimately comes down to individuals. As busy and sleep-deprived students, we have the tendency to choose the easiest&ndash;&ndash;and often laziest&ndash;&ndash;route. Shoving a compostable container in the landfill rather than going back inside to put it in the compost bin is enticing. Sure, it might save a few seconds, maybe a minute. We&rsquo;re all guilty of doing it. But if we all choose to be more aware of where we dispose of our compostable containers, the overflowing landfill bins could become a rare sight.</p>

                    <p>So why all this hubbub about the humble compost bin? For most people, especially city dwellers, recycling is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about sustainability. Now, this is not to disparage recycling&mdash;on the whole it is a productive trend in society, reducing energy use and waste. However, recycling is an exceedingly complex process that has been beset with issues for years. The United States has long exported recycling to China, yet in recent years <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/recycling-rethink-what-to-do-with-trash-now-china-wont-take-it-11576776536" target="_blank">China has started to refuse shipments</a>. Simply put, recycling is expensive, and it&rsquo;s all about the money these days. It should not be abandoned, and promising improvements are being made, but it certainly should not be our sole focus.</p>

                    <p>An estimated <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertilizers" target="_blank">40 percent of the world</a> is fed on agricultural products that depend on synthetic fertilizer. Indeed the invention of synthetic fertilizers has helped to avert global famine in the last century. And yet, there are huge downsides&mdash;synthetic fertilizers are often sourced in fossil fuels and <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10120269" target="_blank">require huge energy input</a>. In addition, most synthetic fertilizers are water soluble, leading to water table pollution and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fertilizers-harm-earth/" target="_blank">disruption of aquatic environments</a>.</p>

                    <p>Compost is our cure&mdash;a solution to large waste pilups, a partial solution to recycling waste issues, and to the potential future famine, as agricultural output struggles to match the rapidly growing population in a world ravaged by the climate crisis.</p>

                    <p>Composting is exceedingly simple&mdash;if you throw your food on some dirt, it will rot away. Microbes, fungi, and protists in the soil take care of the rest. It is nature&rsquo;s recycling, and as so often is the case, nature is much better at it than we are. There are no landfills in a forest: when something falls to the forest floor it is consumed and reincorporated into the soil. There is no reason to abandon this reuse cycle, tested for eons before humanity emerged.</p>

                    <p>Finished compost has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home" target="_blank">many benefits in comparison to synthetic fertilizer</a>&mdash;a soil microbiome, better soil structure, and a more complete micronutrient problem. Removing compostable material from anaerobic environments in landfills into aerobic composting facilities reduces methane emissions. It can even improve recycling&mdash;by encouraging people to remove organic waste from recycling bins, composting makes recycling easier. Without the added cost of removing organic waste from recycling, China might still be accepting shipments of recycling from america.</p>

                    <p>And there is so much potential for composting&mdash;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/sustainable-management-food-basics" target="_blank">more than 20 percent of landfill waste</a> is food material (this does not include compostable paper and yard trimmings). But this is not waste&mdash;this is potential fertility that is being wasted.</p>

                    <p>It can be hard to find the motivation to be environmentally friendly when the most significant determinants of our climate stem from forces outside of our control. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change" target="_blank">The globe&rsquo;s biggest corporations continue to ruin the environment and perpetuate climate change</a>. In comparison, a few white boxes in a trash seem understandably insignificant. But composting is something that we can control. When we finish our meal, we make the decision whether or not to compost our leftovers. That extra second it takes to put a compostable container where it belongs can make all the difference.</p>

                    <p>The planet is in some pretty dire straits right now, and we should not be ignoring any way that we can help. Lots of people will tell you how inefficient or counterproductive recycling is, so now you have something to counter that&mdash;just add compost!</p>
